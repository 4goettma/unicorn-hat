Unicorn pHAT Example(s)
=======================

The Unicorn pHAT is using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, all of these examples must be run with `sudo`, for example

    sudo ./rainbow.py

or

    sudo python rainbow.py


The example in this hat folder are only working on the Unicorn pHAT and are not adapted for the HAT geometry.

rainbow.py
----------

This was the first and only pHAT example at release time and was formally known as 'phat_rainbow.py'. It likely demonstrates the use of `colorsys` to animate through colour hues. And it is likely redundant with the now Unified HAT and pHAT 'rainbow.py'.
