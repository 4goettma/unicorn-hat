RaspberryPi-NeoPixel-WS2812
===========================

Library for driving WS2812 pixels (also known as "NeoPixels" when sold by Adafruit) from a Raspberry Pi.

Wishlist:
* Turn this into a FIFO daemon, like ServoBlaster
* Write some effects fading stuff
* Add whatever functions are present in the Adafruit Arduino library, but not implemented here
* There are a few stupid magic numbers left that I haven't changed to DEFINEs yet
